## ‚öôÔ∏è Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that can learn from and make decisions based on data. Rather than being explicitly programmed to perform a certain task, these systems are trained using large amounts of data and algorithms that give them the ability to learn how to perform the task.
