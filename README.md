## ⚙️ Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that can learn from and make decisions based on data. Rather than being explicitly programmed to perform a certain task, these systems are trained using large amounts of data and algorithms that give them the ability to learn how to perform the task.

- The link will take you to a video that explains everything you need to do.
  
  **Tip:** Save the essays(watch the video) , you will reuse 90%~100% of them for later courses
  
  **Tip_2:** ChatGPT is a great essay writing tool
  
  **Tip_3:** Don't order more than 2 courses at a time,finish them before ordering new ones,you can order 10 at once but it will be overwhelming and it's easy to start finishing the courses for completion and certificates rather than actually learning from them, this isn't school it's knowledge you choose not the one that is forced on you, enjoy it.

  **Tip_4** It takes 2 weeks for the course to arrive via financial Aid,if you are confident you can order a course the moment you recieve one,that way you can position yourself for continues learning without having to wait a week or two for the next one, altough you do have an option to view the lectures before the course arrives, your choice.
